# UI Tone and Primitives

## Voice
- Luxury/atelier tone: confident, refined, evocative.
- Favor "legacy," "atelier," "bespoke," "heritage" over generic app copy.
- Keep CTAs short and ceremonial (e.g., "Initialize New Brand").

## UI primitives
- Buttons: `components/ui/Button.tsx`
- Inputs: `components/ui/Input.tsx`
- Reuse existing variants before adding new ones.

## Styling
- Keep styling in Tailwind utility classes via CDN in `index.html`.
- Avoid global CSS changes unless necessary.
